# Summary of Matrix Calculation Review and Fixes

## Issue Reviewed
Review all matrix calculations in the repository:
1. Specialization/Normalization matrices (RCA)
2. Binary matrices
3. ICE (Economic Complexity Index) calculation

## Critical Fix Applied

### File: `index/ice.py`

**Problem Found:**
The M̃ matrix calculation used an incorrect approximation:
```python
# OLD (INCORRECT)
M_normalized = M_np / k_p.reshape(-1, 1)
M_tilde = (M_normalized @ M_np.T) / k_i.mean()  # Wrong: uses average ubiquity
```

**Solution Applied:**
Implemented the correct formula according to equation (3.6):
```python
# NEW (CORRECT)
M_div_kp = M_np / k_p_safe.reshape(-1, 1)
M_div_ki = M_np / k_i_safe.reshape(1, -1)
M_tilde = M_div_kp @ M_div_ki.T  # Correct: individual industry normalization
```

**Impact:**
- Test shows **complete reversal of rankings** (Spearman correlation: -1.0)
- Matrix elements differ by up to 20.5%
- This was producing incorrect complexity scores

## All Verifications Performed

### ✅ Correct Implementations (No changes needed)

1. **UF.py** - Specialization matrix
   - Formula: `R = (m * X) / (X_c * X_p)` ✓
   
2. **brutos.py** - Specialization matrix
   - Formula: `R = (m * X) / (X_c * X_p)` ✓
   
3. **cbo.py** - Specialization matrix
   - Formula: `R = (m * X) / (X_c * X_p)` ✓

4. **bin.py** - Binary matrix
   - Formula: `binary_matrix = (df >= 1.0).astype(int)` ✓

5. **loc_prox.py** - Location proximity
   - Uses correlation metric (different calculation) ✓

6. **prod_prox.py** - Product proximity
   - Uses co-occurrence formula (different calculation) ✓

## Formulas Reference

### RCA (Revealed Comparative Advantage)
```
RCA_cp = (m_cp × X) / (X_c × X_p)

where:
  m_cp = raw value at location c, sector p
  X = grand total
  X_c = location total
  X_p = sector total
```

### Binary Matrix
```
M_cp = 1 if RCA_cp ≥ 1, else 0
```

### M̃ Matrix (Equation 3.6)
```
M̃_pp′ = Σ_i (M_pi × M_p′i) / (k_p,0 × k_i,0)

where:
  M_pi = binary matrix element
  k_p,0 = diversity of location p
  k_i,0 = ubiquity of industry i
```

### ICE (Economic Complexity Index)
```
ICE = (K_2 - mean(K_2)) / std(K_2)

where K_2 is the 2nd eigenvector of M̃
```

## Testing

Run the tests to verify everything works:

```bash
# Test the corrected formula
python3 test_ice_calculation.py

# Compare old vs new implementation
python3 compare_ice_implementations.py
```
